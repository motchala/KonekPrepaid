! if you have just cloned this program of mine, then you should follow these steps to run the system completely. !


these files are for copy and pasting purposes, so that the system can run as intended.
the files above aren't the ones being used by the system, hence why you need to copy and paste them inside the main class.




STEPS TO COMPLETE:

1. Copy the 3 files from this project folder (Text File, Json File, SQL File)
2. After copying, go to the "KonekApplication" project folder
3. Open "Debug" folder > then open "net8.0" folder
4. Paste the 3 files inside that folder (you should see tons of files and folders from that folder)
5. Done! Run the program, and that's it! It should be working now
